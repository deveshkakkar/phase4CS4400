We used React.js along with Express, mySQL, Bootstrap, and CSS. We used React.js, CSS, and Bootstrap for designing our frontend, we of course used mySQL for our database, and we used Express as a backend framework.

We each worked on separate screens. Kashyap figured out our routing and login system, and Devesh, Kevin, and Rishi worked on making the screens that correspond to different queries.
